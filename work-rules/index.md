# WORK RULES - LASLZO BOCK


# Work rules 1: Become a founder

**Choose to think of yourself as a founder**  
**Now act like one**  

 
* Building an exceptional team or institution starts with a founder. But being a founder doesn’t mean starting a new company. It is within anyone’s grasp to be the founder and culture-creator of their own team, whether you are the first employee or joining a company that has existed for decades.   
* Google was fortunate that our founders had such strong beliefs about the kind of company they wanted to create.  
*  Just as Larry and Sergey laid the foundation for how Google treats its people, you can lay the foundation for how your team works and lives  

> My goal is for Google to lead, not follow  

# Work rules 2: Build a great culture

* Think of your work as a calling, with a mission that matters.
* Give people slightly more trust, freedom, and authority than you are comfortable giving them. If you’re not nervous, you haven’t given them enough.
 
> Our culture was shaping our strategy, and not the other way around.  

## Cultures:  

* Mission: “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.  
> This kind of mission gives individuals’ work meaning because it is a moral rather than a business goal.  
> Crucially, we can never achieve our mission, as there will always be more information to organize and more ways to make it useful. This creates motivation to constantly innovate and push into new areas.  
* Transparency: If you believe people are good, you must be unafraid to share information with them
> a newly hired software engineer gets access to almost all of our code on the first day. We share everything, and trust Googlers to keep the information confidential.  Weekly TGIF all-hands meeting: CEO updates from the prior week, product demonstrations, welcoming of new hires, and most important, thirty minutes of fielding questions  (Q&A) from anyone in the company, on any topic.  
* Voice: This means giving employees a real say in how the company is run.

# WORK RULES 3: FOR HIRING

* Hire only the best by taking your time, hiring only people who are better than you in some meaningful way, and not letting managers make hiring decisions for their own teams.  
* It’s about finding the very best people who will be successful in the context of your organization, and who will make everyone around them more successful.  

* What matters is what you bring to the company and how you’ve distinguished yourself.  

* Hiring is the most important people function you have, and most of us aren’t as good at it as we think. 
* Refocusing your resources on hiring better will have a  
higher return than almost any training program you can develop.  

# WORK RULES 4: FOR FINDING EXCEPTIONAL CANDIDATES

- Get the best referrals by being excruciatingly specific in describing what you’re looking for.
- Make recruiting part of everyone’s job.
- Don’t be afraid to try crazy things to get the attention of the best people.

> CEO laid the foundation for Google’s hiring system & final reviewer of every— yes, every—candidate > because no one has precisely the same understanding of what the CEO is looking for.  

# WORK RULES 5: FOR SELECTING NEW EMPLOYEES

* Set a high bar for quality: Before you start recruiting, decide what attributes you want and define as a group what great looks like. A good rule of thumb is to hire only people who are better than you. Do not compromise. Ever.  
* Find your own candidates: LinkedIn, Google+, alumni databases, and professional associations make it easy.
* Assess candidates objectively: include subordinates and peers in the interviews, make sure interviewers write good notes, and have an unbiased group of people make the actual hiring decision. Periodically return to those notes and compare them to how the new employee is doing, to refine your assessment capability.
* Give candidates a reason to join: Make clear why the work you are doing matters, and let the candidate experience the astounding people they will get to work with.  
`1. Questions to ask > predict how they will perform at work`  
- Real work sample test (29 percent)
- General cognitive ability (26 percent).
- Structured interview, including behavioral and situational (26 percent)

    `2. Identify attributes to screen and ask `  
- General Cognitive Ability
- Leadership
- “Googleyness.”: enjoying fun, intellectual humility, a strong measure of conscientiousness, comfort with ambiguity, ve taken some courageous or interesting paths in life
- Role-Related Knowledge: whether someone actually knows anything about the job they are taking on

  `3. Interview feedback & commentary`  
- All interview feedback to comment specifically on each attribute.
- Written feedback includes the attribute being assessed, the question asked, the candidate’s answer, and the interviewer’s assessment of that answer.

    `4. Constantly check that your hiring process actually works`  
- Revisit applications of rejected candidates to assess if we made errors, to correct & learn from them
- Keyword list: assign a weight for each keyword that appeared on CV, how frequent it occurs on successful/unsuccessful CV.

# WORK RULES 6: FOR MASS EMPOWERMENT (where employees feel and act like owners)

- Eliminate status symbols.
- Make decisions based on data, not based on managers’ opinions.
- Find ways for people to shape their work and the company.
- Expect a lot.

## Eliminate status symbols

- Only 4 levels at Google: individual contributor, manager, director, and vice president

> “At Google, leadership didn’t equate to the title. I’d often give my top performers leadership opportunities and help them learn the art of leading without the titled authority. Over time, it became a no-brainer to move these leaders to positions of people management, as they had thoroughly learned how to inspire leadership, followership, and drive decisions across their peer group."  

> "We also eliminate other signifiers and reinforcers of hierarchy: Our most senior executives receive only the same benefits, perquisites, and resources as our newest hires"  

> If you want a non-hierarchical environment, you need visible reminders of your values. Otherwise, your human nature inevitably reasserts itself. Symbols and stories matter.  
>  

## Make decisions based on data, not based on managers’ opinions  

- Make everything transparent, share all the promotion data with Googlers. They crunched the numbers, organized a series of talks, recorded them so people could watch them later, and built a site to share all the data.
    - Working with much more senior people has only a small effect
    - The product area doesn’t matter.
    - Bad feedback doesn’t hurt you. In fact, almost every person who gets promoted has constructive feedback in their promotion materials > when you present people with reality, they want to get better.
- Before implementing any of the improvements, we tested them to make sure they work. We used A/B testing, showing evaluators two sets of search results side by side, then watching their behavior and getting their feedback on which results were better
- Almost any major program we roll out is first tested with a subgroup.

## Find ways for people to shape their work and the company.  

- Engineers have 20 percent of their week to focus on projects that interest them, outside of their day jobs but presumably still related to Google’s work
- Googlegeist “the spirit of Google":
    - A survey that would capture the interests of all Googlers and would also be scientifically robust and measurable over time
    - Two ways to submit your responses: confidentially or anonymously.
    - Virtuous cycle: take action on what we learn
    - Defaulting to open: reports are automatically published to the entire company & Q&A with CEO
    - Focuses on outcome measures that matter: not just employee engagement, focus on innovation (maintaining an environment that values and encourages both relentlessly improving existing products and taking enormous, visionary bets), execution (launching high-quality products quickly), and retention (keeping the people we want to keep)
    - Regularly reveals opportunities to improve elsewhere at Google, ask Googlers to suggest fixes that would benefit lots of their colleagues and that we can implement within two or three months.

## Expect a lot.  

- The truth is that people usually live up to your expectations, whether those expectations are high or low.
- Specific goals (“Try to get more than 90 percent correct”) were not only more motivating than vague exhortations or low expectations (“Try your best”)
-  What managers miss is that every time they give up a little control, it creates a wonderful opportunity for their team to step up, while giving the manager herself more time for new challenges.  

> Pick an area where your people are frustrated, and let them fix it. If there are constraints, limited time or money, tell them what they are. Be transparent with your people and give them a voice in shaping your team or company. You’ll be stunned by what they accomplish.  

# WORK RULES 7: FOR PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT

- Set goals correctly.
- Gather peer feedback.
- Use a calibration process to finalize ratings.
- Split rewards conversations from development conversations.
 
> Improve performance by focusing on personal growth instead of ratings and rewards  

</aside>  

## Set goals correctly.  

- 2 primary complaints: it took too much time & the process wasn’t transparent enough, which raised concerns about fairness
- The performance management system has always started with goal setting.
- Apply OKRs, set ambitious goals that we know we won’t be able to achieve in all cases

## Measuring performance  

- Questions to ask:
    - Were the right low performers identified?
    - Were the right people identified for promotion?
    - Were the discussions meaningful?
    - Was the process fair?
- Use 5 point-rating scale 

## Ensuring fairness  

- Calibration: the process of checking a measuring instrument to see if it is accurate
- A manager assigns a draft rating to an employee—say, “exceeds expectations”—based on nailing OKRs but tempered by other activities, like the volume of interviews completed, or extenuating circumstances such as a shift in the economy that might have affected ad revenues. Before this draft rating becomes final, groups of managers sit down together and review all of their employees’ draft ratings together in a process we call calibration.
- Avoid bias
    
  Avoid defensiveness and promote learning with one simple trick  
    
    - As a manager, you want to tell people not only how they did, but also how to do better in the future.
    What is the most effective way to deliver those two messages? >> Do it in two distinct conversations.  
    - Annual reviews happen in November and pay discussions are to happen a month later.
    - “Traditional performance management systems make a big mistake. They combine two things that should be completely separate: performance evaluation and people development. Evaluation is necessary to distribute finite resources, like salary increases or bonus dollars. Development is just as necessary so people grow and improve.” If you want people to grow, don’t have those two conversations at the same time. Make development a constant back-and-forth between you and your team members, rather than a year-end surprise.
  
    The wisdom of crowds... it’s not just for recruiting anymore!  
    - Use peer feedback >> 360 survey
    
    Putting it all together for promotions  
    
    - Promotion decisions, like rating decisions, are made by committees. They review people who are up for promotion and calibrate them against promoted people from prior years and well-defined standards, to ensure fairness.
    
    # WORK RULES 8: FOR MANAGING YOUR TWO TAILS
    
    - Help those in need.
    - Put your best people under a microscope.
    - Use surveys and checklists to find the truth and nudge people to improve.  
    - Set a personal example by sharing and acting on your own feedback.
    
 
    💡 The biggest opportunities lie in your absolute worst and best employees  
    
     ## Help those in need  
    
    - Poor performance is rarely because the person is incompetent or a bad person. It’s typically a result of a gap in skill (which is either fixable or not) or will (where the person is not motivated to do the work).
    - The bottom 5%: training > find another suitable position > leave/fire
    - Cannot make them become a superstar, but improve performance to average, not bottom anymore
    - This cycle of investing in the bottom tail of the distribution means your teams improve... a lot. People either improve dramatically or they leave and succeed elsewhere.
    
    ## Put your best people under a microscope  
    
    - Study your top performer closely: understanding precisely what makes your best people succeed in your unique environment
    - Top performers live in a virtuous cycle of great output, great feedback, more great output, and more great feedback. They get so much love on a daily basis that the extra programs you might offer can’t actually make them much happier.
    - Have the people who are best at each attribute train everyone else.
    
    ## Use surveys and checklists to find the truth and nudge people to improve  
    
    Best manager attribute  
    
    1. Be a good coach.
    2. Empower the team and do not micromanage.
    3. Express interest/concern for team members’ success and personal well-being.
    4. Be very productive/results-oriented.
    5. Be a good communicator—listen and share information.
    6. Help the team with career development.
    7. Have a clear vision/strategy for the team.
    8. Have important technical skills that help advise the team.
    
    > Survey teams twice a year and see how managers are doing.  
    
    Sample feedback questionnaire  
    
    1. My manager gives me actionable feedback that helps me improve
    my performance.  
    1. My manager does not “micromanage” (i.e., get involved in details
    that should be handled at other levels).  
    1. My manager shows consideration for me as a person.
    2. My manager keeps the team focused on our priority
    results/deliverables.  
    1. My manager regularly shares relevant information from his/her
    manager and senior leadership.  
    1. My manager has had a meaningful discussion with me about my
    career development in the past six months.  
    1. My manager communicates clear goals for our team.
    2. My manager has the technical expertise (e.g., coding in Tech,
    accounting in Finance) required to effectively manage me.  
    1. I would recommend my manager to other Googlers.
    
    ## Set a personal example by sharing and acting on your own feedback.  
    
    - Care about upgrading your organization. Everyone says they do, but few really take action. As a team leader, a manager, or an executive, you have to be willing to act personally on the results you see, changing your own behavior if needed, and be consistent over time in staying focused on these issues.
    
    # WORK RULES 9: FOR BUILDING A LEARNING INSTITUTION
    
    - Engage in deliberate practice: Break lessons down into small, digestible pieces with clear feedback and do them again and again.
    - Have your best people teach.
    - Invest only in courses that you can prove to change people’s behavior.
    
    💡 Measure what is actually learned and what behaviors change as a result  
     
    💡 A learning organization starts with a recognition that all of us want to grow and to help others grow  
    
    ## Engage in deliberate practice  
    
    ## You learn the best when you learn the least  
    
    - A simple practice, without feedback and experimentation, is insufficient
    - It’s difficult to keep learning and stay motivated when the road stretching ahead of you looks exactly like the road behind you.
    - It’s a better investment to deliver less content and have people retain it than it is to deliver more hours of “learning” that is quickly forgotten.
    - Every meeting ended with immediate feedback and a plan for what to continue to do or change for next time
    Example:  
    Before meeting: “What are your goals for this meeting?” “How do you think each client will respond?” “How do you plan to introduce a difficult topic?"  
    After meeting: “How did your approach work out?” “What did you learn?” “What do you want to try differently next time?”  
    
    ## Build your faculty from within  
    
    - For the learner, having actual practitioners teaching is far more effective than listening to academics, professional trainers, or consultants.
    - It is generally far better to learn from people who are doing the work today, who can answer deeper questions and draw on current, real-life examples. They understand your context better, they are always available to provide immediate feedback, and they are mostly free.
    - In addition to benefiting the person being advised, the advisors themselves benefit as well. Through repeated experience, our
    company’s leaders are building their listening and empathy skills and their own self-awareness.  
    - Our challenge is to figure out together how to help our Googlers teach themselves.
    
    ## Only invest in courses that change behavior  
    
    - 4 levels of measurement in learning programs: reaction, learning, behavior, and results.
    - Reaction: engage >< impart knowledge >> how students feel about your class tells you nothing about whether they have learned anything >> they should be focused on learning, not on assessing whether the balance of presentation to team exercise to individual exercise is correct.
    - Learning: assesses the change in the student’s knowledge or attitude, typically through a test or survey at the end of the program
    - Behavior: Seeking external perspectives both provides a more comprehensive view of the student’s behavior and subtly encourages him to assess his own performance more objectively
    - Results: see actual results
    
    # WORK RULES 10: FOR PAYING UNFAIRLY
    
    - Swallow hard and pay unfairly. Have wide variations in pay that reflect the power-law distribution of performance.
    - Celebrate accomplishment, not compensation.
    - Make it easy to spread the love.
    - Reward thoughtful failure.
    
    ## Pay unfairly: Your best people are better than you think and worth more than you pay them  
    
    - Fairness in pay does not mean everyone at the same job level is paid the same or within 20 percent of one another.
    - Fairness is when pay is commensurate with contribution
    - 2 capacities to pay:
        - A very clear understanding of what impact is derived from the role
        - Having managers who understand the reward system well enough that they can explain to the recipient, and to others who might ask if the word were to get out, exactly why a reward was so high and what an employee can do to achieve a similar reward.
    
    ## Celebrate accomplishment, not compensation  
    
    - The joy of money is fleeting, but memories last forever
    
    ## Make it easy to spread the love  
    
    - Trusting people to do the right thing generally results in them doing the right thing.
    - Allowing people to reward one another facilitates a culture of recognition and service, and is a way to show employees that they should be thinking like owners rather than serfs.
    
    ## Reward thoughtful failure  
    
    - While incentives and goals matter, the act of considered risk-taking itself needs to be rewarded, especially in the face of failure
    
    # WORK RULES 11: FOR EFFICIENCY, COMMUNITY, AND INNOVATION
    
    - Make life easier for employees.
    - Find ways to say yes.
    - The bad stuff in life happens rarely... be there for your people when it does.
     
    💡 The Best Things in Life Are Free (or Almost Free)  
    
    
    > We use our people programs to achieve three goals: efficiency, community, and innovation. Every one of our programs exists to further at least one of these goals, and often more than one.  

    - Encouraging efficiency in your professional and personal lives
    - A community that spans Google and beyond
    - It’s a moving reminder of how the smallest investments of care and resources can have tremendous results.
    
    # WORK RULES 12: FOR NUDGING TOWARD HEALTH, WEALTH, AND HAPPINESS
    
    - Recognize the difference between what is and what ought to be.
    - Run lots of small experiments.
    - Nudge, don’t shove.
    
    > Nudge: to encourage or persuade someone to do something in a way that is gentle rather than forceful or direct  
    
    ## Manager should do with new hires:  
    
    - Have a role-and-responsibilities discussion.
    - Match your Noogler with a peer buddy.
    - Help your Noogler build a social network.
    - Set up onboarding check-ins once a month for your Noogler’s first six months.
    - Encourage open dialogue.
     
    💡 Remember that not everyone is a born manager. By telling managers exactly what to do, we actually took one annoying item off their to-do list. They had less to think about and could focus instead on acting.  
    
    
    ## Orientation for new hires:  
    
    - Ask questions, lots of questions!
    - Schedule regular 1:1s with your manager.
    - Get to know your team.
    - Actively solicit feedback — don’t wait for it!
    - Accept the challenge (i.e., take risks and don’t be afraid to fail... other Googlers will support you).
    
    💡 Organizations make decisions about how to structure their workspaces, teams, and processes. Every one of these decisions nudges us to be open or closed, healthy or ill, happy or sad.   
    
    - We are all constantly nudged by our environment and nudging those around us. Use that fact to make yourself and your teams happier and more productive.
    - Save your big checks for the times when your people are most in need, the moments of greatest tragedy and joy
    
    # WORK RULES 13: FOR SCREWING UP
    
    - Admit your mistake. Be transparent about it.
    - Take counsel from all directions.
    - Fix whatever broke.
    - Find the moral in the mistake, and teach it.
    
    # WORK RULES
    
    1. Give your work meaning.
    2. Trust your people.
    3. Hire only people who are better than you.
    4. Don’t confuse development with managing performance.
    5. Focus on the two tails.
    6. Be frugal and generous.
    7. Pay unfairly.
    8. Nudge.
    9. Manage the rising expectations.
    10. Enjoy! And then go back to No. 1 and start again.  
    
    # TO BUILD THE WORLD'S FIRST PEOPLE OPERATION TEAM
    
    ## 4 principles: Strive for nirvana  
    
    - Nirvana: a blissful place where every Googler was growing seemingly without effort, as our programs worked behind the scenes to fill every job, create learning opportunities, and help Googlers be more productive, healthier, and happier.
    - HR that just works: must deliver the basics, flawlessly, every time
    - Mass customization: produce goods and services to meet individual customers’ needs with near–mass production efficiency > had a consistent philosophy underpinning our people processes, but tweak the details of each process based on what different parts of Google need
    - Anticipation: delivering what people need before they know to ask for it > People are happy when you give them what they ask for. People are delighted when you anticipate what they didn’t think to ask for
    
    ## Use data to predict and shape the future  
    
    - Agreeing on a common set of definitions for all people data > Only then can you accurately describe what the company looks like & Start predicting the future
    - Act based on prediction > Be open to crazy ideas
     
    💡 Test an idea on just one team. Or try the idea on the whole company at once, but announce that it’s a test for just a month and then you’ll decide whether to make it permanent based on how people react.  
    
    ## Improve relentlessly  
    
    - Running your HR department or team with the same standards of clear objectives, continuous improvement, and reliability that are used in the rest of your company will make your organization credible and trusted.
    
    ## Field an unconventional team  
    
    - Built a different kind of People Operations team by applying an unconventional “three-thirds” hiring model
    - HR people teach us about influencing and recognizing patterns in people and organizations; the consultants improve our understanding of the business and the level of our problem solving; the analytics people raise the quality of everything we do.
