# CREATING A CAREERR PAGEE THAT CONVERTS


A well-crafted career page has the power to win over and convert qualified candidates. However, in order for that to be the case, it requires careful oversight and to be recognized for what it truly is—a valuable tool in the recruiting tool belt.  

Today there’s no shortage of creative and engaging ways for companies to attract candidates. And while it’s true that successful talent teams employ a healthy mix of recruiting tactics, few levers remain as important and relevant as the tried and true company career page.  

Compared to in-depth employer branding campaigns and other forms of recruitment marketing, career pages might seem fairly straightforward and simple. But that doesn’t mean they should be neglected and unattended.  

Rather, the most effective career pages require careful attention to detail and regular updating in order to remain relevant, engaging, and capable of converting curious candidates into applicants.  

The Basic Principles  
While there are many ways to set up a successful page, there are some core ideas that should inform how you design your page, what information to include, and how to use visual elements like videos and photographs to enhance user experience.  

1. Be Consistent With Your Brand Identity 
The best way to convince people to apply to your company is to tell them who you are. Your career page needs to have clear and consistent messaging that communicates the uniqueness of your corporate culture.
