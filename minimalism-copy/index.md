# MINIMALISM


 # What is minimalism?  
- A minimalist intentionally focuses on what really matters. For some, this means eliminating the ‘stuff’ that doesn’t make you happy.
- Minimalism is the intentional choice to live with less.
- Minimalism is not a lack of something. It's simply the perfect amount of something.
- On the contrary with minimalism is consumerism. 

# Benefits of minimalism: Less is more 
- Time: Less time to do house chores. More time to build hobbies, habits, knowledge 
- Money: Less consumerism, more saving
- Freedom: Freedom from fear, worry, overwhelm, depression 
- Improve life's quality: Buy less but high quality, focus on quality than quantity 

# Minimalism spirit 
- Minimalism is a journey where we sàng lọc dần things that do not bring up any values để chúng ta không phải tốn năng lượng vô ích vô những thứ đó nữa. Và từ đó nó rộng đường cho chúng ta được tập trung sống với những thứ tạo ra nhiều giá trị nhất cho cuộc sống của chúng ta. 
- Root of minimalism: Find out What do we really need? How much do we need? > have enough, no more, no less 
- Steve Jobs: Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains. 

# Misconceptions about Minimalism 
- Count on Possession: only 50/100 things.
- Minimalism >< Frugal Living (cut off all expenses)
- Boring lifestyle 
- Family/Marriage is not a minimalism lifestyle
