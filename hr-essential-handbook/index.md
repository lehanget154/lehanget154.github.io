# Chương 5: PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT

- Planning and preparation:
    - Make sure you're familiar with the evaluation form and the rating structure
    - Review individual goals set during previous discussions to assess how well the employees are meeting them or met them.
    - When you schedule the meeting, choose a day and time when neither of you is under pressure.
- Starting the meeting:
    - Set a warm tone—informal but professional—from the beginning so that the employee feels at ease and comfortable.
    - Make sure the employee understands this is a two-way conversation and encourage him or her to bring up any issues you haven't mentioned.
- The discussion:
    - Let the employee talk; listen, and try not to interrupt
    - Review the employee's significant accomplishments
    - Then you can move on to the form, focus on the employee's job performance, not personal characteristics
    - Need to improve: Be prepared to back up your points with specific examples, including the tangible ones you collected when you wrote the evaluation. Stay calm, and don't express your constructive criticism in such a way that you seriously disturb a good employee. Remember that, in the end, you're trying to encourage improvement.
- Closing:
    - End the meeting in a professional and positive manner
    - Ask the employee to summarize the discussion you just had; make sure you are on the same page regarding the important points
    - Agree on a plan for the future with the employee. Write goals for the next evaluation cycle that are specific, measurable, challenging but achievable, and time-specific. You can offer to help him or her reach those goals.
    - Encourage the employee, and be sure to express appreciation for good work and for participating in the evaluation process
